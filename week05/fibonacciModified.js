prompt:
implement a modified Fibonacci sequence using the follwing definition:

given terms t[i] and t[i+1] where i (1, infinity), term t[i+2] is computed as:

t i+2 = t i + (t i+1)squared

Given three integers, t1, t2 and n, compute and print the nth term of a modified fibonacci sequecnce.

Example:
t1= 0
t2 =1
n = 6
-t3 = 0 + 1squared = 1
-t4 = 1 + 1squared = 2
-t5 = 1 + 2squared = 5
-t6 = 2 + 5squared = 27
